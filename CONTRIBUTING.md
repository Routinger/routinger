# Contributing to Routinger

Open Source is driven by contributions. We are very happy seeing you here. We want to make contributions as easy and transarent as possible. It can range from (but not limited to)
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a feature
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing Features
- Becoming Maintainers

## How to contribute?
1. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/Routinger/routinger/issues) page.
2. If you want to contribute a new feature or solve a issue it is recommended you make it a issue for others to have a brief look at what's happening.
3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
4. [OPTIONAL] Update the Readme file.
5. Issue that pull request.

**[NON CODING BACKGROUND] If you are from a non-coding background and still want to contribute to the `artistic` labeled issues. The issue's discussion will contain a brief description of `How to contribute` but mostly you will be asked to navigate to `lib/dev_assets` folder and copy your assets that you want to contribute over there.**

**[FOR CODERS] People willing to use dependency other than those listed in pubspec.yaml have to discuss it first in the issues tab. Therefore, we recommend you to first open an issue for the thing you are going to change. They should make sure that-:**
-  The package they are going to use adhers to the new null safety protocols set by flutter.
-  The version used should be a stable release version.
-  It should be compatible with the other packages that are in use and must not break them. If for some reason two packages are incompatible. The person suggesting the change has to also suggest a new package to be used and refactor the code accordingly before issuing the pull request.

## Any contribution you make will be under GPL 3.0
Your contributions will be covered under the same license GPL 3.0 as the whole project. You can contact the maintainers for more assistance.

## Report Bugs using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/Routinger/routinger/issues)
Reporting bugs or making feature requests is as easy as filling out a simple form. We have made a bug report and feature request issue template to help you guide and to reduce clutter.

## Some more tips
- Use consistent coding style. Make sure to use the same spaces and tree structure as is used in the source code.
- Make sure the app's core functionality doesn't break before issuing a pull request.
- Make sure to break different widgets and not make a single file too long to read.

## Final Word
Thank you again. The project was not possible without your contributions.
